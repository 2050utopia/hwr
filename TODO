Dependency on tomoe
-------------------

- Rewrite tomoe_canvas in pure pygtk.
- Write a replacement for tomoe_char and tomoe_writing in pure python.

Dependency on ghmm
------------------

- Write a HMM library in pure python, possibly using numpy.
(at least the viterbi decoder)

Model manager
-------------

- Add a evalall command that run and compare all models.
- Add computation time benchmarking to evaluation results.

- Add support for virtual models. "model1+model2+model3" creates a composite
models which is a combination of the 3 models. "+" should be a reserved
character.

- Support comma separator for a command. Ex: "fextract,init,train".
- Support range separator for a command. Ex: "fextract-train".

Models
------

- See the effects of computing non-diagonal values in the covariance matrix.
- Rewrite get_emission_matrix to support feature vectors with n dimensions.

- Try number of states proportional to number of feature vectors.
- Try non uniform initial segmentation.
- Try viterbi training.

- Try velocity and speed as feature vectors.
- Try feature vectors that are not sensitive to stroke order (OCR).

- Try stroke and sub-stroke HMMs.

Data
----

- Rename corpora with more details like input device (mouse, pda, tablet),
stroke order correct/incorrect, carefully drawn or not.
- Be able to choose the training and evaluation corpora from the models.
