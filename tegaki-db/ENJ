Changed the structure to move the static js to tegaki-webcanvas (where javascript can be improved upon in that project)
added recognizing and storing of characters by using xml (check tegakidb/hwdb)
* we want to transfer some other way, either json or find ways to slim down the points (i saw a "smooth" function, havnt tried it yet)
because the XML gets too big too fast
Setup a template for hwdb that uses enjastroke.js to display the recognizer

Setup of more structure in the get repo:
data/www - this is where static content will reside (certain aspects of settings.py will have to be edited to reflect this)
        /css - where static css will reside
        /img - where static images will reside
        /js  - where static js will reside
           /enjsi - my javascript interface for character input
                    requires dojo (see setup notes) so more cross-browser than canvas
                    but i need to add your character.js functionality
        /hmtl - where static html will reside if need be (placeholder files in each of these for now)

Updated to use Django 1.0 conventions (meant some changes to tegakidb/urls.py)

Setup a custom User class that extends the Django User model.
tegakidb/users/models.py
data/conf/settings.py (had to add CUSTOM_USER_MODEL setting)

Hooked in tegakidb/hwdb/

updated data/conf/settings.py to use my settings (with sample user/password) to reflect some of the infrastructure changes
